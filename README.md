# Travel and Tourism Customer Behavior Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior in the travel and tourism industry by leveraging a dataset that includes customer demographics, contact types, city tiers, and engagement metrics. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior and predict product purchase likelihood using machine learning algorithms.



## Introduction

The **Travel and Tourism Customer Behavior Analysis** project aims to provide valuable insights into the travel industry's customer base by analyzing key metrics and predicting customer behavior. The analysis includes a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the implementation of machine learning models to forecast product purchase rates and identify the factors driving these purchases.

Features

	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies trends and patterns in customer behavior and product purchases.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of product purchases.
	•	Feature Importance: Highlights key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

Results

The project successfully identified significant factors that influence customer behavior in the travel and tourism industry and achieved high accuracy in predicting product purchase likelihood. Detailed results can be found in the Model_Development.ipynb notebook.
